---

- Know your body, emotions, thoughts and behaviour
	- These all affect eachother
```feelings
		Thoughts
		   ^
		   |
Behaviour <â€“> Emotions
		   |
		   v
		  Body
```

- Normalise emotions and reactions
	- Fear is normal
	- Low belief in own ability is normal
- Get good at describing what is difficult
- Create a good weekly structure and good routines.
	- Overall plan, "vision", "purpose".
		- If you don't have a long term goal then the failures will completely destroy your hope.
		- If you have a long term goal then it allows you to see your failures as part of the process.
	- Set up time to focus and time where you can be more distracted.
	- Break activities that don't pull you too far away from your focus.
- Celebrate your wins, small and large.
	- Imperative to feeling of mastery and worth
	- ex. writing a great job application is AMAZING regardless of outcome
	- Just getting up on time is an achievement
	- Journaling???
- Lower pressure on yourself
	- During unemployment you need less pressure on yourself 
	- Your environment already puts more pressure on you
- Set up time for you to relax
	- ex. From 9-3 you set time to work, but after 3 you don't work.
	- relief from feeling of 24 hours of pressure
- Be aware of the two types of worries
	1. What you can change / Just worries
	2. What you cannot change / Hanging worry / Sword of Damocles
		- "Will I ever get a job?"
			- Affects emotions <--> Body <--> Behaviour <--> Thoughts
- Practice mindfulness to sort the just worries from the hanging worries
- Maintain presence in your life
	- You can infinitely worry about things in your life
		- Most of the time your worries are not pertinent to your own wellness
	- Pull your attention to your present experiences
		- Without judgement, accept your thoughts
			- "I'm worried about work in xyz way and that is ok"
			- "I feel like this and that is ok"
		- Pay attention to your senses. 
			- What can you see?
			- What can you smell?
			- What can you hear?


###### Work on acceptance
- Life situation
- Circumstances outside of your own control
- Negative thoughts do not necessarily map on well to reality
- Accept that you are capable (of something), you have innate resources and possibilities.

###### Self care is work necessary
- Regular sleep, varied food intake, physical activity
- Becoming better at self care and structure are valuable things that will help you every day of your life, not just in a work setting and regardless of outcomes in your job seeking journey.

###### Reframing personal beliefs
- In times of worries, normalise feeling worried
- Worry does not mean xyz about you, it only means you are a person who worries
